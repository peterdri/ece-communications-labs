In this lab you will use the an SDR (software defined radio) for both receiving and transmitting signals. You will be using either an RTL-SDR (receive only) or a USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral, both receive and transmit). Both SDRs are I/Q receivers with wide bandwidth, programmable center frequency, programmable gain and a choice of sample rates.

You will then begin using complex signals to create an SSB demodulator. As you work through it, keep the following questions in mind:

- How is an SSB signal demodulated into an audio signal?
- What methods are used to tune to a desired signal?

## Deliverables

- 2 GRC files:
  - a resampling SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method
  - a direct sampling SSB receiver using Weaver\'s method
- A single page with answers to the 4 questions posed throughout the lab.
  - There are 4 questions which are all carefully labelled **Deliverable Question X**. Each question should take only one to two sentences to answer and address the concepts being explored.

There are also a number of questions included within the text which are not denoted "deliverable". Written answers to these questions are not required, but an effort should be made to think about and answer these questions as they are encountered
