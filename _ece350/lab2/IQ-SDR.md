## Objectives

This part of the lab will guide you through receiving and transmitting signals using a software-defined radio. While using the SDR as a receiver you will learn about:

- frequency offsets,
- clock sources and reference signal synchronization,
- dynamic range and clipping.

While transmitting with the SDR, you will:

- see the effect of transmitting real signals, as well as complex signals,
- explore the minimum and maximum power output from the SDR,
- measure the power of the SDRs transmission using both an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer.

## Part 1 Deliverables

- There are three deliverable questions in this part of the lab. They are clearly indicated.
  - Each question requires approximately 1 line of writing and addresses concepts, not details. Answer the questions and submit a single page containing the answers to your TA at the end of the lab.
